https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/
Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.
Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]

Example 2:
Input: [1,2,2,3,2,1,1,3]
Output: [1, 2]

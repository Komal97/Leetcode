https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.

Example 1:
Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"

Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.

                stack.pop()
                k -= 1
            stack.append(digit)
